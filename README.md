# OS Kernel Projects ‚Äì Texas A&M University

This repository contains a series of low-level system programming projects developed in C++ as part of the Operating Systems course at Texas A&M University. Each project (MP1‚ÄìMP7) builds core OS components from the ground up, simulating real-world kernel functionalities.

## üîß Project Highlights

- **MP2 ‚Äì Frame Allocator**  
  Implemented a bitmap-based physical memory frame manager supporting allocation and deallocation of memory pages.

- **MP4 ‚Äì Virtual Memory**  
  Built a recursive page table and virtual memory allocator supporting dynamic user-level mappings and address translation.

- **MP5 ‚Äì Thread Scheduler**  
  Designed a cooperative multitasking scheduler using FIFO logic with basic thread lifecycle handling.

- **MP6 ‚Äì Disk Driver**  
  Developed a disk I/O driver with thread coordination and blocking read/write calls, simulating hardware interrupts.

- **MP7 ‚Äì File System**  
  Created a minimal filesystem with inode management, block allocation, and support for sequential file read/write.
